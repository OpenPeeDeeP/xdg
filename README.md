# XDG

A cross platform package that tries to follow [XDG Standard](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) when possible. Since XDG is linux specific, I am only able to follow standards to the T on linux. But for the other operating systems I am finding similar best practice locations for the files.
